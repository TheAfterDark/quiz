Our journey began as a team of four. We sat together and worked out a game plan; what the type of game should be, what would be a fitting title for the game and who takes care of what. It all seemed to be going perfectly but sadly there was a little set-back along the way which resulted in two of our members deciding that they would cease to co-exist within our team and decided, that they would take it upon themselves to challenge the computing world, leaving fellow coders Stefan and Liam to fend by themselves. Stefan started by creating the ground code for our game, from which on we could then add our own special touch to the game. That part of the process went without any major complications. In the meantime, Liam decided to get a bit creative and create their own pixel art character for the game. This task seemed to be fairly easy at first, but when it came to drawing the side perspective of the character, he had some trouble making it look good. That was the first part of our game-coding-project. Now we entered the second main phase of the game: finishing the game with our own twists implemented and creating a website for our game. It was now the holidays, so we had to meet outside of school. We decided it were best if we do it on a discord call. That way Stefan could stream his screen and Liam could watch it and follow along. Stefan then began implementing some new additions such as health bars or items which could restore lost hp. Whilst watching him, in case there were any complications, Liam took it upon himself to create the website and finish everything off which had to be added to the website. This was the harder part of the Project and some problems occurred. Stefanâ€™s main problem was the health bar and the attacks. The website came with some complications of its own as well, such as multiple server errors or problems with running the website. But nothing the team couldn't handle.
